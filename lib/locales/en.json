The architecture follows a classic multi-pass compiler design, starting with a custom lexical analyzer that tokenizes the input source code. Parsing is handled by a recursive descent LL(1) parser, which constructs a clear Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Semantic analysis guarantees type safety and scoping rules via Syntax-Directed Translation techniques before finally generating valid executable Java Bytecode using the ASM library. This academic project successfully demonstrates a deep, practical understanding of language design, formal grammars, and the internal workings of the JVM. The target language features a C-like control flow (while, conditional cases) integrated with Prefix (Polish) notation for arithmetic and boolean expressions, supporting n-ary operators and statement grouping.",
