            "longDescription": "This project implements an end-to-end data processing and analysis pipeline to explore and visualize a massive dataset of over 130 million data points related to the anime industry (anime, characters, actors, user interactions). Developed entirely in Python within JupyterLab, the work utilizes the uv package manager to guarantee deterministic and highly efficient dependency resolution. The core of the analysis focuses not only on compiling statistics but on true 'Data Storytelling', highlighting patterns, trends, and outliers over time to offer compelling insights to domain experts and fans alike.",
